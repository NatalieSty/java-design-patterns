#Design pattern samples in Java.


##Abstract Factory
Intent: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.


##Builder
Intent: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.


##Factory Method
Intent: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

##Prototype
Intent: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

##Singleton
Intent: Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

##Adapter
Intent: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
